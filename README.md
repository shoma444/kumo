Repository for codes I wrote for my own personal use.

cpp scripts should be compiled using g++ -std=c++11
python codes are all written in py2.7 and for best compatibility, use Anaconda

To use the codes, please refer to the following:

file_encrypter.cpp
This encrypts and decrypts a given text file (ASCII) with a user specified password. 
The encryption is done using standard prime number modular arithmetic, and is meant for pedagocical use.
