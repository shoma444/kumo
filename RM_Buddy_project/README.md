WHAT IS RM Buddy?
RM Buddy is a program for tidying up directories (and sub-directories within). It will look for files and directories that may be duplicates (e.g., documents that you may have downloaded multiple times), by looking for key words like "... copy ..." and phrases like "... (2)" or "... {3)" etc. You can review, and delete selected files as well.

HOW TO USE:
(1) Launch the app. The main menu should prompt you to enter a directory that you would like to clean up. 

(2) Enter the path (e.g., /Users/user/Downloads/), and hit Start.

(3) If there are files and/or directories that appear to be duplicates, you should be presented with a page listing them. You can review, and delete selected (or all) files shown. If there are many, you may need to scroll down. Files and directories are separeted. 

(4) IMPORTANT: Once you delete these files, they WILL BE LOST. Be careful!

NOTES:
-The program will not go beyond 10 nested sub-directories.
-You may not have permissions to enter certain directories, or to delete certain files. 
-This program will only examine names of files/folders. It may miss some duplicates, and in rare cases, it may return false positives. Please be careful when you are deleting files.
